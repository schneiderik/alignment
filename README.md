A fantasy puzzle adventure for Arduboy

## Gameplay
Gems decend two at a time down rows onto the play area. Swap rows along with the gems currently on them to control where they land. Match two gems to clear them and attack an enemy.  Each row represents a fantasy weapon which affect enemies differently. The level is complete when the enemy's health reaches zero. A player has three health. Health is lost if gems in a column exceed the max. When this happens, all gems in that column are cleared. The game is over if all three health are lost or the player defeats the evil sorcerer.
